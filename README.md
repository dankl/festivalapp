The FestivalApp
======================

FestivalApp is my playground to learn more about Android. Its my first non "hello world" Android App. Be nice to to :D.

The application idea was born from my last festival visit. 
I needed some background to the next band. The festival map was 10 minutes away in my car.
So I thought, cool I have my phoe with me. But: ther ewas no network connection or the network was really slow ...
